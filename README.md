# Bug-Tracker-Django
An ongoing Django project building a bug tracking website similar to Jira and Mantis.

This webapp should allow a user to add a bug report, view the bug report and list all completed bugs reports on the home page. More components are considered to be added to the project in the future such as Projects and User Comments. 

There are only three webpages in development for the Django app:
Home Page
Bug Detail Page
Add Bug Page

There is only class so far in the project which is the Bug class.

(This README is due to changes.)
