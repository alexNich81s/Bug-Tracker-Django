# Bug-Tracker-Django
An ongoing Django project building a bug tracking website similar to Jira and Mantis.

This web app should allow a user to add a bug report, view the bug report and list all completed bugs reports on the home page. The web app interacts with the Bug class 

There are only three webpages in development for the Django app:
Home Page,
Bug Detail Page,
Add Bug Page

More components are considered for to the project in the future such as Projects and User Comments.
